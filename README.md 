# macOS Configuration

Automated macOS setup using chezmoi, Homebrew, and shell scripts.

## Fresh Install

Run this one command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgoodric/macos-config/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

This will:
1. Install Homebrew
2. Install chezmoi
3. Clone and apply dotfiles
4. Install all Homebrew packages
5. Configure macOS defaults
6. Run app-specific setup

## Manual Steps

After automated setup, see [POST_INSTALL.md](POST_INSTALL.md) for remaining manual steps.

## Updating

After making changes to your dotfiles:
```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.zshrc        # Edit the source
chezmoi apply                # Apply changes
chezmoi cd                   # Go to source directory
git add . && git commit -m "Update zshrc"
git push
```

## TODO
- [ ] Atuin Sync
- [ ] Work vs Personal Brewfiles - Can we have chezmoi ask if this is work or personal, run a common brewfile, and then either a personal or work brewfile based on the answer?
- [ ] Can we automatically configure which icons are on the dock?
- [ ]
